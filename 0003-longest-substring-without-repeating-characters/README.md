**Implementation Note:** Use the sliding window technique with two pointers (left and right) and a set to track characters in the current window. Expand the right pointer to grow the window, and when a duplicate is found, shrink from the left until the duplicate is removed. Track the maximum window size throughout.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - each character is visited at most twice (once by right pointer, once by left pointer)  
**Space Complexity:** O(min(m, n)) - where m is the size of the character set and n is the length of the string

<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=nj0ylarm">3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><p>Given a string <code>s</code>, find the length of the <strong>longest</strong> <span data-keyword="substring-nonempty"><strong>substring</strong></span> without duplicate characters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;abcabcbb&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The answer is &quot;abc&quot;, with the length of 3. Note that <code>&quot;bca&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;cab&quot;</code> are also correct answers.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;bbbbb&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The answer is &quot;b&quot;, with the length of 1.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;pwwkew&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The answer is &quot;wke&quot;, with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, &quot;pwke&quot; is a subsequence and not a substring.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>s</code> consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.</li>
</ul>
